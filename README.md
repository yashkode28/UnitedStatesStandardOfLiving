# UnitedStatesStandardOfLiving
Exploratory Data Analysis on costs of living and well-being factors in the United States

Gathered a dataset from Kaggle, employed Pandas to parse the dataset from CSV to a data frame, and merged newly researched data onto the data frame based on each U.S. State. 

Pandas: inserting researched data into data frames, filtering out relevant data, performing feature engineering tasks to manipulate data, and extract information on the most expensive areas to live in. 

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization: bar charts, box plots, and correlation matrices to display relationships between different cost factors. 

Scikit-learn for regression: 2D regression between costs and income, 3D regression for income, happiness satisfiability, male/female life expectancy, logistic regression decision tree for Metro availability.
